# Enterprise AI Discovery Kit → Why the AI system exists

Successful AI programs start with **clarity**, not technology.

This repository provides discovery frameworks and operating model tools
used to translate ambiguous business problems into buildable,
governed, and adoptable AI solutions.

## Why discovery matters
Most enterprise AI initiatives fail due to:
- Unclear decision ownership
- Misaligned incentives
- Undefined success metrics
- Hidden operational constraints

Discovery makes these visible **before** build and scale.
